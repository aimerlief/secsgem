# Installation

Official releases are available via
[Pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/secsgem) repository. The easiest way
to install these is using a package manager like pip:

```
$ pip install secsgem
```

In order to use the current development code, which might be instable at
times, use the git repository directly:

```
$ pip install git+git://github.com/bparzella/secsgem
```
